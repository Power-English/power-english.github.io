				[The Joker crashes the party]<br><br>

				The Joker: <br><br>
				We made it! [fires a shotgun into the air to get people's attention] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are tonight's entertainment! I only have one question: Where is Harvey Dent? [paces around the room, pointing his shotgun at random guests] Do you know where Harvey is? Do you know who he is? Do you know where I can find Harvey? I need to talk to him about something. Just something little, huh? No... You know, I'll settle for his loved ones. 
				<br><br>

				Guest:	<br><br>
				We're not intimidated by thugs! <br><br>
				The Joker: <br><br>
				You know, you remind me of my father. [grabs him at knifepoint] I hated my father!

				<br><br>
				Rachel Dawes: <br><br>
				[offscreen] Okay, stop!
				<br><br>

				The Joker: <br><br>
				[walks over to her] Well hello, beautiful! You must be Harvey's squeeze, hm? And you are beautiful. Oh, you look nervous. Is it the scars? Do you wanna know how I got 'em? [grabs her chin as she continuously tries to look away] Come here, look at me. See, I had a wife - beautiful, like you - who tells me, I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks. Hey. [she squirms, and he forces her to keep looking at him] One day they carve her face. We have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just want to see her smile again, hmm? I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. Soâ€¦ [Rachel tries again to look away, he grabs her face and forces her to look at him.] I stick a razor in my mouth and do thisâ€¦ to myself. [Directs attention towards the scars] And you know what? She can't stand the sight of me! She leaves. Now, I see the funny side. Now, I'm always smiling. <br>

				[Rachel knees him] <br><br>

				The Joker: <br><br>
				[chuckling] A little fight in you. I like that. <br><br>

				Batman: <br><br>
				[appears out of nowhere and attacks the Joker] Then you're gonna love me.
