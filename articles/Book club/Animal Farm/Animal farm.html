				<h3>Introduction to Animal Farm</h3>
			<p>
				‘Animal Farm’ is a novel. It is a famous story. ‘Animal Farm’ was
				written by George Orwell in 1945. Mr Orwell went to a farm.
				He saw a boy walking with a horse. Orwell thought if animals
				could talk what would they think about human beings? He also
				thought that humans have all the power and treat animals
				badly. If animals had power and could talk what would they do? <br><br>

				‘Animal Farm’ is an interesting story. In the novel the animals
				can talk. ‘Animal Farm’ is a metaphor
				 for Russia from 1917 to
				1991. During this time, Russia was called the Soviet Union or
				the USSR. <br><br>

				From 1917 to 1991 Communism existed in Russia (the Soviet
				Union). This means everyone is equal. There are no rich people
				and there are no poor people. However, there were many
				problems in the Soviet Union from 1917 to 1991. ‘Animal Farm’
				is about these problems. 
			</p>

			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 1 </h3>
			<p>
				It is evening. Mr Jones is a farmer. He lives at Manor Farm. Mr
				Jones is not a nice man. Mr Jones is very cruel to his
				animals. When he falls asleep all the animals at Manor
				Farm have a meeting. <br><br>

				Major is an old pig. All the animals like him. He is
				intelligent. Major wants to tell all the animals about a
				dream he had. All the animals are quiet. They want to listen to
				Major. He tells the animals that he is old. Major thinks he is
				going to die soon. Before he dies, Major wants to tell the
				animals about humans. <br><br>

				Major tells the animals that they have a difficult life. All the
				animals have to work very hard. They do not get any
				rewards. Humans eat eggs. They come from animals.
				Humans eat cheese. That comes from animals. Humans drink
				milk and that also comes from animals. When animals die
				humans eat them. Major said that no animal is happy. Humans
				are the enemy of animals. <br><br>

				Animals are strong. Humans are weak. Why are animals so sad? 
				It is because humans are so cruel. Major wants the animals to
				chase Mr Jones away. If he goes away, all the animals will be
				happy. <br><br>

				Major talks about his dream. In his dream only animals live on a
				farm. There are no human beings. All the animals are happy.
				They are all equal. All animals have a lot to eat. They are never
				hungry. They do not have to work for humans. <br><br>

				When Major has finished talking about his dream all the
				animals are happy. They like his dream. The animals want his
				dream to come true. Major tells the animals: 
				<ul>
					<li>What walks on four legs is a friend. </li>
					<li>What has wings is a friend.</li>
					<li>What walks on two legs is an enemy. </li>
				</ul>

				Major makes three rules. They are: 
				<ol>
					<li>No animal can live in a house. </li>
					<li>No animal can sleep in a bed.</li>
					<li>No animal must kill another animal. </li>
				</ol>

				All the animals are excited. They want Major to carry on
				talking. Mr Jones wakes up. He goes to the window. He fires his
				gun. Major has to stop the meeting. All the animals quickly go
				back to their places. <br><br>

				Mr Jones does not know that the animals can talk. He also does
				not know that they have meetings.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
			<p>
				Major died on Wednesday. All the animals
				were very sad. They all remembered
				Major’s dream. Snowball and Napoleon are two pigs. They are
				intelligent. Snowball and Napoleon make a plan to chase Mr
				Jones away from Manor Farm. <br><br>

				Every night the animals have a meeting. Some animals like Mr
				Jones. They do not want to chase him away. Mollie is a
				pretty horse. She likes Mr Jones because he gives her
				sugar. Moses is a bird. He does not like the pigs. He tells the
				animals not to believe them. <br><br>

				Mr Jones has become very cruel. He does not feed his animals.
				One day in June Mr Jones goes to the pub. He comes back to
				Manor Farm and falls asleep. The animals are hungry. They are
				also angry. The animals decide to chase Mr Jones away. <br><br>

				Suddenly the animals run into the house. The dogs chase Mr
				Jones away. <br><br>

				The farm now belongs to the animals. Major’s dream has come
				true. All the animals are happy. They eat a lot of food. The 
				animals are going to turn Mr Jones’s house into a museum. No
				animal will ever live in the house. <br><br>

				The next morning the animals have a meeting. The pigs can
				read and write. They change the name of Manor Farm. It is now
				called Animal Farm. There are going to be seven rules in Animal
				Farm. They are based on Major’s ideas. <br>
				The seven rules are: 
				<ol>
					<li>What has got two legs is an enemy. </li>
					<li>What has got four legs or a wing is a friend.</li>
					<li>Animals cannot wear clothes.</li>
					<li>Animals cannot sleep in beds.</li>
					<li>Animals cannot drink alcohol. </li>
					<li>No animal can kill another animal. </li>
					<li>All animals are equal. </li>
				</ol>
				<br>
				These seven rules are never going to change. <br><br>
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 3</h3>
			<p>
				The animals are very happy. They work very hard. No animals
				fight. No animals steal anything. There is a lot of food to eat.
				The pigs do not work. They tell the other animals what to do.
				The pigs become the leaders of Animal Farm. On Sundays the
				animals do not work. They have a meeting every Sunday. All the
				animals get together. All animals are taught how to read and
				write. The pigs are the most intelligent animals. Some animals
				cannot remember the seven rules. They are told to remember,
				“Four legs are good and two legs are bad.” <br><br>

				Napoleon tells the animals that education is very important. He
				takes nine new puppies away from their mothers. Napoleon said
				he was going to educate them. <br><br>

				Boxer and Clover are two horses. All the animals really like
				them. Boxer works very hard. If there is a problem
				he says, “I will work harder.” <br><br>

				Not all the animals work as hard as Boxer. Mollie, the pretty
				horse, gets up late. She does not work hard. The cats
				disappear when it is time to work and come back at meal times.   <br><br>

				At the meetings on Sundays the pigs tell the other animals
				what to do. Snowball and Napoleon are intelligent pigs but they
				did not agree with each other. <br><br>

				Things began to change. <br><br>

				Something strange happens. Some milk is missing. It is given to
				the pigs. Also, all the apples were eaten by the pigs. They tell
				the other animals that they have to drink the milk and eat the
				apples because they are intelligent. If the pigs left then Mr
				Jones would come back. The animals hated Mr Jones. They
				agreed that the pigs could have all the apples and drink more
				milk. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
			<p>
				Napoleon and Snowball tell the birds to go to other farms.
				They would tell the animals to copy what the animals have done
				at Animal Farm. Mr Jones is angry. He wants some help. Mr
				Jones wants to go back to his farm. A lot of farmers do not
				like him. They do not help Mr Jones. However, the farmers do
				not want their animals to chase them away. <br><br>

				The world heard about Animal Farm. Some stories were good.
				For example, Animal Farm was a wonderful place. All of the
				animals were happy. They do not need human beings. Some
				stories about Animal Farm were bad. For example, some animals
				ate each other. They were very cruel.  <br><br>

				In October Mr Jones planned to come back to Animal Farm.
				The animals were all prepared for this attack. As the humans
				approached, Snowball ran towards them. The animals followed
				him. They attacked Mr Jones and all the other humans. The
				humans had guns. They shot a few sheep. The animals were
				angry. They attacked the humans. They ran away.
				All the animals were very excited. They had defeated (defeat means when you win a victory over someone else.) the humans. There was a big celebration. All the animals sang a 
				song. It was called ‘Animals of the World.’ The animals were
				also sad because some sheep had been killed.  <br><br>

				Where was Mollie, the pretty horse? The animals were worried.
				They thought the humans had taken her away. Mollie was in
				fact hiding in the stable. She said she was frightened and did
				not like to fight. <br><br>

				Snowball gave a speech. He said that animals should always
				protect Animal Farm. The pigs made a medal. It was called
				‘Animal Hero, First Class.’ Boxer and Snowball were given a
				medal. This was because they were brave. The animals called
				this day ‘The Battle of the Cowshed.’ It was a very important
				day for Animal Farm.
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
			<p>
				It is December. Mollie began to change. She would not work.
				Mollie said she was ill. Clover thought she was doing something
				bad. He asked Mollie if she was talking to human beings.
				Animals were not allowed to talk to humans. Mollie
				said this was not true. She was not telling the truth.
				In fact, humans had been giving Mollie gifts. <br><br>

				Three days later Mollie disappeared. She ran away. Mollie did
				not like living at Animal Farm. No animal ever spoke about her
				again. <br><br>

				In January it was very cold. There was a meeting. The pigs told
				the animals they were in charge of Animal Farm. They would
				make all the decisions. They decided to do this because the
				pigs said they were the most intelligent animals. However,
				Snowball and Napoleon did not like each other. They could not
				agree on any decision. Snowball was a good speaker. All the
				animals liked him. Napoleon was crafty and cunning (crafty and cunning means intelligent but not nice). He was secretly planning to get rid of Snowball. <br><br>

				Snowball had a plan. He wanted to build a
				windmill. Snowball told the animals that it was a
				good idea. It would make Animal Farm a better
				place. Snowball said the windmill could be built in
				one year. Napoleon was against Snowball’s plan. <br><br>

				The animals were divided. Half agreed with Snowball. Half
				agreed with Napoleon. There was a meeting. All the animals
				came. Snowball told the animals that the windmill would
				improve their lives. The animals liked what he said. Only
				Napoleon was angry.  <br><br>

				Suddenly there was a frightening noise. Nine big
				fierce dogs ran towards Snowball. He just managed to
				escape. All the animals watched in horror. The nine big fierce
				dogs were chasing Snowball. He ran away. Snowball was never
				seen again. All the animals were sad because he had been
				chased away. <br><br>

				The animals were terrified. Where did the nine big fierce dogs
				come from? Napoleon had taken them from their mothers when
				they were babies. He trained them to become fighting dogs.
				The fierce dogs liked Napoleon. They became his guard dogs. <br><br>

				Napoleon spoke to all the animals. He was surrounded by his
				dogs. Napoleon said that all animals would receive orders from
				the pigs. He would make all the important decisions at Animal
				Farm. No animal disagreed with Napoleon because they were
				frightened of him. All the animals thought that Napoleon
				reminded them of Mr Jones. <br><br>

				Three weeks later. Napoleon had a meeting. He said that the
				windmill was going to be built. Napoleon said that the windmill
				plan was his idea. He said that Snowball stole it from him. The
				animals were confused(confused means when you do not understand). They did not ask any questions. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
			<p>
				The animals worked very hard to build the windmill. The pigs
				told the other animals what to do. They gave orders and did
				not do any work. Boxer and Clover worked the hardest. They
				never complained. Boxer and Clover would say two things. They
				were “Napoleon is always right” and “I will work harder.” <br><br>

				Napoleon said that only pigs could talk to humans. Some animals
				were not happy. They thought all humans were the enemy. Did
				not Major tell them that what walks on two legs is an enemy?
				No animal complained. If they did complain Napoleon’s fierce
				dogs would either bark at them or bite them.  <br><br>

				The pigs moved into the house that belonged to Mr Jones.
				They said that they needed a quiet place to work. Again Major
				said that no animal should live in a house. The pigs ignored this
				rule. The animals were too frightened to complain. The pigs
				said this because they ran Animal Farm and they needed a
				quiet place to stay. <br><br>

				The pigs began to sleep in beds. This was another rule that the pigs broke. Rule Four said that no animal can sleep in a bed. The
				pigs changed this rule. It now said,
				‘No animal can sleep in a bed with sheets.’
				The other animals said nothing. They were frightened. <br><br>

				The windmill was nearly complete. One night there was a storm.
				The windmill was destroyed. All the animals were very sad.
				They had worked so hard to build the windmill. In
				the morning all the animals went to the windmill. It
				was in ruins(ruin means when something is destroyed or broken). Napoleon said, “Snowball did this. He destroyed
				the windmill.” The animals were shocked. They could not believe
				Snowball would destroy the windmill. <br><br>

				When anything went wrong at Animal Farm Napoleon blamed
				Snowball. Napoleon told the animals that Snowball was a friend
				of Mr Jones. Even though Snowball had left Animal Farm he
				was blamed for everything that went wrong. This was
				Napoleon’s plan. He fwanted all the animals to hate Snowball. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 7</h3>
			<p>
				There was another very cold winter. The animals were
				rebuilding the windmill. In January, there was no food for the
				animals. Only Boxer and Clover worked happily. All the other
				animals thought that they had a difficult life. <br><br>
				
				The pigs had a plan. Animal Farm would sell eggs to humans.
				The hens were unhappy. They did not want to give their eggs to
				humans. The hens were angry. They smashed their
				eggs. Napoleon was very angry. He said that if the
				hens smashed their eggs they would be killed. Nine
				hens were killed by Napoleon’s fierce dogs. The hens could do
				nothing. Their eggs were sold to humans. <br><br>

				A few days later something terrible happened. Napoleon
				told all the animals that there was an important meeting.
				He was surrounded by his nine fierce dogs. Napoleon was
				wearing his medals. The animals were silent.  <br><br>

				Suddenly, the dogs chased four pigs. They bit them. Napoleon
				told the animals that the four pigs had been secretly talking to
				Mr Jones. They were Snowball’s friend. The dogs killed the
				pigs. There was blood everywhere. <br><br>

				All the animals were frightened. Napoleon said if any animal did
				not listen to him they would be killed. If an animal complained
				about anything they would be killed. All the animals were very
				sad. Animal Farm was worse than Manor Farm. One very
				important rule was ‘no animal must kill another animal.’ Today
				the fierce dogs had killed some animals.
				Even Boxer was sad. He said, “This is not why we chased Mr
				Jones away.” <br><br>

				In the evening an animal noticed a change in the sixth rule. It
				now read 
				<ol>
					6. No animal can kill another animal without a reason. 
				</ol>
				The last three words had been added on by the pigs. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
			<p>
				The animals worked hard to complete the windmill. It was
				completed in April. They had little food. Only the pigs and dogs
				had enough to eat. Napoleon began to eat at the dining table.
				This was another rule he broke. In the beginning it was agreed
				that no animal should eat at a dining table. <br><br>

				Even though all animals still hated humans, Napoleon was
				secretly friends with them. Napoleon told the
				animals he was going to sell wood to a human. The
				animals were not happy. They could not do anything. The
				humans took the wood. They gave Napoleon money. The money
				was not real money. He had been tricked. <br><br>

				The farmers attacked Animal Farm on the 16th June. They blew
				up the windmill. The animals attacked the humans. They ran
				away. Many animals were killed and a lot were injured. Boxer
				was also injured. All the pigs were hiding when the humans
				were attacking Animal Farm. <br><br>

				Two days later there was a big celebration. Napoleon was given
				more medals. At Animal Farm the 16th June was called ‘The
				Battle of the Windmill.’ 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 9 </h3>
			<p>
				Boxer had been injured in ‘The Battle of the Windmill.’
				However, he still carried on working. Boxer would repeat,
				“Napoleon is always right” and “I will work harder.” He was
				getting old. Boxer was not as strong as he used to be. There
				was another very cold winter. The animals had little food. Only
				the pigs and dogs had enough to eat. They were never hungry.
				Napoleon told the animals that they should be happy. He said if
				Mr Jones returned life would be worse for the animals. They
				did not believe him but they were too frightened to complain. <br><br>

				In April, Napoleon became President of Animal Farm. Songs
				were written about him. Poems were also written about him.
				There were pictures of Napoleon all over Animal Farm. He lived
				like a king. <br><br>

				In the autumn something bad happened. Boxer became ill. All
				the animals loved and respected Boxer. He was dying. Napoleon
				said he was going to take Boxer to a hospital. The animals were
				not happy. The animals wanted to look after Boxer. Apart from
				Mollie and Snowball no animals ever left Animal Farm. <br><br>

				A few days later a van came to Animal Farm. Boxer
				was put inside. All the animals said goodbye to
				Boxer. He was not going to hospital. Napoleon had
				sent Boxer to be killed. <br><br>

				No animal ever saw Boxer again. 
			</p>
			<br><br>
			<h3>Chapter 10 </h3>
			<p>
				Many years passed. Most of the animals who created Animal
				Farm had died. Mr Jones had also died. Only a few animals
				could remember Snowball and Boxer. The windmill was working.
				Clover was a very old horse and Napoleon was still President of
				Animal Farm. The dogs and pigs had become very rich. The
				other animals were still very poor. They worked very hard.
				They were still hungry most of the time. <br><br>

				One day Clover saw something strange. She saw a pig trying to
				walk like a human. Napoleon was also walking like a human.
				There was complete silence. All the pigs were walking like
				humans. No animal could complain. If they did they would be
				killed. The dogs shouted, “Four legs good, two legs even
				better.” <br><br>

				The animals noticed something else. The seven rules had been
				replaced with one rule. It said, 	 
				<div style="text-align: center;"><b>All animals are equal but
				some animals are better than other animals.</b> </div><br>

				The pigs began to copy humans. They would be cruel to all
				animals. The pigs listened to the radio and had telephones.
				Napoleon started to wear Mr Jones’ clothes. <br><br>

				One evening some humans came to Animal Farm. They went into
				the house. All the animals watched in secret. In the dining
				room there were six pigs and there were six humans. They
				were laughing and talking. The humans and pigs were eating and
				drinking together. One human said, “Humans like pigs. We do
				not like other animals.” <br> <br>

				Napoleon then said, “Pigs like humans. We do not like other
				animals.” <br><br>

				The animals outside just listened in silence. <br><br>

				Napoleon said that the pigs own Animal Farm. He was going to
				change the name of Animal Farm back to Manor Farm. The pigs
				and the humans began to laugh. The animals outside just
				watched. They could not tell the difference between the pigs
				and the humans. 
			</p>
			<br><br><br>
			<h3>Historical Context</h3>
			<p><b>Animal Farm</b> is a historical novel. It is a metaphor for Russia
			from 1917 to 1945. In order to understand the story students
			should know about Russian history. </p><br><br>

			In 1917 the King of Russia was called Tsar Nicholas. Like
			Mr Jones he was not a nice person. The King of Russia
			did not care about the Russian people. They were very
			poor and he was very rich. <br><br>

			Lenin was a very important man. He told the Russian people
			they could have a good life. They did not need the King. Like
			Major in Animal Farm, Lenin had ideas that would change the
			lives of all Russians. Lenin died in 1921. <br><br>

			A lot of Russian people had meetings. They wanted to get rid
			of the King. In Animal Farm the animals wanted to get rid of
			Mr Jones. Two very important people in Russia were Trotsky
			and Stalin. They planned to get rid of the King. <br><br>

			Snowball is Trotsky. Napoleon is Stalin. <br><br>

			In November 1917 the King of Russia was killed. His family was
			also killed. Mr Jones is chased away from Manor Farm. In 1921,
			Russia changed its name to the Soviet Union. The animals
			changed the name of Manor Farm to Animal Farm. <br><br>

			In Russia Communism was set up. This mean everyone is treated
			equally. There are no rich people and there are no poor people.
			The government makes sure everyone is happy. In Animal Farm
			all the animals are treated equally. <br><br>

			In the first few years of Communism everyone was happy in
			the Soviet Union. Boxer and Clover represent the
			ordinary Russian people. They worked very hard.
			They did not get many rewards. <br><br>

			Like Mollie the pretty horse, many Russians escaped from
			Russia. A Lot of countries wanted to destroy the Soviet Union.
			In the novel, humans attack Animal Farm twice. <br><br>

			Trotsky and Stalin did not agree with each other. Russia was a
			poor country. Trotsky wanted to build factories. He
			said this would make Russia rich. It was a good idea.
			Stalin stole this idea. In Animal Farm, Snowball
			wants to build a windmill. Napoleon steals this idea. <br><br>

			Napoleon trained the dogs to become fierce. Stalin trained
			some men. They were called the KGB. They would kill anybody
			who did not like Stalin. Stalin managed to make Trotsky leave
			Russia. In Animal Farm Napoleon’s dogs chase Snowball away.
			In Russia most people began to live in fear of the KGB and
			Stalin. No one could complain. If they did they went to prison
			or were killed. In Animal Farm the animals never complain. They
			were too frightened to complain. <br><br>

			In Russia it is very cold during the winter. Most people had
			very little to eat. In Animal Farm the hens are killed by the
			dogs because Napoleon is angry. In Russia when Stalin was in
			power millions of people were murdered. <br><br>

			Communism had changed. It did not help poor people. It
			seemed to be a big mistake. In 1941, Russia was attacked by
			Germany. Germany was strong. Everyone thought Russia would
			be defeated. However, the Russian army defeated the
			Germans. In Animal Farm ‘The Battle of the Windmill’
			represents what happened in Russia from 1941 to 1945. <br><br>

			By 1945 Stalin was still President of the Soviet Union (Russia).
			He did not care about the Russian people. At the end of
			‘Animal Farm’ the pigs do not care about the other animals.
